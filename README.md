# Introduction
One of the major features of NextJs, is its page-routing tech that developers love. NextJS eliminates a lot of overhead that developers had to explicitly perform for proper page routing. I have been using NextJS for about 2 years now, so I tried to replicate this feature for Vanilla HTML websites.

# How to use it ?
Just clone this repo, and run ``yarn dev`` on your terminal and go to ``http://localhost:3000/`` there you can see how you can add pages and get them routed.

# Todos:
    1. Its working fine, however if a new page(.html file) is added you will have to restart the server, will be fixing this in the next commit.
    2. Handling more complex directory structures.
    3. Support for dynamic pages.
